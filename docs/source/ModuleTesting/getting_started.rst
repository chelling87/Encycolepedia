.. warning:: 

  At this point, it is assumed you have a working computer with all of the
  pre-requisite packages installed. A day may come when those will be included
  in the tutorials, where I explain how to install Alma9, when I tell you how
  to install all the necessary packages, how to put on pants and the right way
  to put toilet paper on the roll, but it is not this day. Today we test.


Testing a module can be very simple or very difficult, there is little middle
ground. The reason is that if you do not have everything set up correctly, or
you have misconfigured something, things can go terribly wrong and it won't
always be clear why. *Please*, take some time to follow this tutorial to gain a
(hopefully) greater insight into how to properly test a module. These tutorials
are experimental, but hopefully we can build on this to provide on-boarding
material for new testers and reference material for veterans who need a
refresher.
