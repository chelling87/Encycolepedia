.. warning:: 

  At this point, it is assumed you have a working computer with all of the
  pre-requisite packages installed. A day may come when those will be included
  in the tutorials, where I explain how to install Alma9, when I tell you how
  to set up your hardware, and install all the necessary packages, but it is
  not this day. Today we test.


I'll add more here later. This is essentially just a test that I can make an
intro page and add some overall structure to the next few pages.
