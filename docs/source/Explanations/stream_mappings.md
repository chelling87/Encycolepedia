# Stream Mappings

At times it seems that the stream mappings are all over the place. There are
certainly differences between the three big setup types: hybrid burn-in, modules, 
and petals/staves. Here I will explain that while they may seem arbitrary, there
is, if not a logic, a **reason** why the streams need to be what they are.

## Hybrid Burn-In

For the Hybrid Burn-in testing, our stream mappings are tied to how the panels are wired.

## Modules

For Module testing, our stream mappings are tied to how the frames are wired.

## Petals/Staves

For Petal/Stave testing, our stream mappings are tied to how the **whatdoyoucallit?** are wired.
