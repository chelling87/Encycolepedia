Welcome to the Encycolepedia!
=============================

Hi, I'm Cole Helling. I will elucidate the various topics for the ITk Strips to
the best of my abilities. In the tutorials, I try to always point to the
official documentation whenever possible. I may copy the instructions from
those documents here to avoid having the user flip back and forth, however,
please consult the links in the event of an issue. It's possible that something
has changed.
   
.. warning::

  This project is under active development. None of this is to be considered
  official, and I wouldn't hold my breath on it all being correct. I make
  mistakes in my understandings and my explanations. I've also included 4
  errors on purpose, but I will not tell you which. If you find something
  wrong, please let me know. Better yet, make a merge request.
